# Node Server UI base

Skeleton for a sever/client TypeScript pair.

## Details

This skeleton has 3 parts.

1. A super simple node.js daemon skeleton with socket.io and colorful logging facilities.
2. Basic React app skeleton with webpack, TypeScript, reactstrap, and socket.io client.
3. Deployment scripts

Many apps can just be run locally for testing or development or directly on a target machine which is useful if there special hardware attached.

## create-node-server-ui-app

Simple steps to make a new project/app based on this skeleton.

1. clone
1. Update `README.md` and `package.json`
1. `git commit -am 'Initial commit'`

## Development

The development environment is intended to be a first class and modern.

- Reload on save for client ui and server daemon running locally or remotely.
- Full color easy console logging.
- Easy debugging with source maps everywhere.
- Dependency changes automatically maintained with git hooks.

### Prerequisites

[**Node 10+**](https://nodejs.org/en/download) must be installed on your development system.
[**Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) is nice to have but **optional**.

### Setup

Install dependencies and setup development environment.

```bash
yarn setup
```

#### Non-global Yarn?

While easier if Yarn is installed globally, this works fine without it.

```bash
# Installs yarn locally
npm install
# Setup development environment
npm run setup
```

> You can run any command from the cheat sheet by replacing `yarn` with `npm run`.

### Running

To run this full system, **two** separate programs need to be run.
One for the web **UI** and one to actually do something persistent, the **daemon**.

### Remote Execution

In order to run the daemon on remote systems, the deploy config needs to be setup.
Copy or move `deploy/config.sample.ts` to `deploy/config.ts` and edit as desired.

Configs for daemons often need to be slightly different than when running locally.
The deploy script will replace `daemon/config.ts` with `daemon/config.remote.ts` on the remote system before execution.

### Suggested Environment

Use Visual Studio Code.
